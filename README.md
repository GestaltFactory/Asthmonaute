Asthmonautes

Unity · C# · Cross-Platform Port · Game Remake

This project was a contract from Breathing Games, where I was tasked with remaking an existing educational game originally developed in Game Maker. My role was to rebuild the game in Unity, improve its design and functionality, and make it cross-platform (supporting Windows, WebGL, and potentially mobile).

My responsibilities included:
    Re-implementing all core gameplay mechanics from the original version.
    Enhancing visual feedback, input handling, and UI/UX for younger users.
    Optimizing performance and adapting the game to run on multiple platforms.
    Ensuring compatibility with Breathing Games' open-source and health-focused ecosystem.

The new Unity version provides a cleaner codebase, easier maintainability, and broader accessibility compared to the original. This remake also aligns with Breathing Games’ mission to deliver open, collaborative health games to underserved communities.

Asthmonautes is an interactive educational game developed in Unity by Breathing Games to promote asthma self-management in children. 
As part of a series of open-source "games for health", it invites players to explore engaging scenarios where they identify asthma triggers and learn coping strategies in a playful, immersive environment.

Key features include:
    User-friendly gameplay: Designed with kids in mind—simple mechanics, colorful visuals, and minimal text.
    Health education objectives: Teaches recognizing triggers, correct inhaler use, symptom monitoring, and preventive behaviors.
    Proven design principles: Co-designed with children and healthcare professionals following open participatory methods.

Asthmonautes merges game design with health education, offering a free and adaptable tool that bridges serious gameplay and therapeutic value—making it a standout example of collaborative, open-source innovation in medical games.
